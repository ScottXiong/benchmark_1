Subject:Packaging form for WMT CAN / PlayDay / PGT

Hi Frances, Jason,

This is LInda from Benchmark Design. We have been asked by Walmart Canada to reach out to you for artwork design for following items under Play Day program.

Attached is a packaging form for Walmart Canada, we use it to collect the information we need from you in order to design your packaging. Please return the completed packaging form(s) by 07/29/2017. 

In case you are unfamiliar with it, here is what you should do next:

* Please fill in the data on the packaging form as completely as possible, as we are required to present this form to Walmart Canada when submitting your files for approval.

* Be sure to include the category your items belong to, the department, the dates for in-store, art due, pack-out, and shipping (we can't get the artwork approved without these dates!). Also provide the buyer's name and email address. as we will need this when submitting for their approval. 

* Send the packaging forms and your die line files to us as soon as possible. Note that the packaging process can take from 10 to 22 days depending on the number of files, complexity, etc. The dieline files must be in illustrator format with dimensions clearly marked, and 1:1 size (actual size).

* For PDQ trays, sidekicks, pallets, Walmart Canada requires a rendering or 3D image to understand the structure. Please prepare and send to us along with your files.
* Please make sure your die lines are properly named - use the SKU number or UPC number, and be sure the number appears on the Packaging Form as well.

Please feedback to us on any errors or needed modifications. Once the files are correct, we will need your official approval. It can be as simple as an email saying "These files are approved". Once we have your approval, we need to route the files through Walmart Canada for approvals. Once Walmart Canada approves the artwork, we will send to our translation agency for French translations if needed, and then send back to Walmart Canada for final approval. Once Walmart Canada approves the artwork with French, we will release the final artwork to your printer, or directly to you.

Special notes:

**Warnings on packaging

If warnings are required on your packaging, please note that Walmart Canada requires you to provide approved warnings to us (actual wording, size and placement requirements).
Canada requires all packaging to be bilingual - but when we send the draft artwork to you, French will not yet be added. We will use placeholder text to represent the French. It will start with an 'FRE' or just an 'F' - this will be replaced with French *after* both you and the Walmart buyer have approved the artwork.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. The team here at Benchmark looking forward to working with you.

Thanks & Best Regards
 
Linda Tang
