<p style="color:red;">Please note:  Our approval of the files is for the graphic consistency with Walmart’s style guide/modular look! You still need to send artwork to the testing agency for approval for any legal/compliance issues. Our approval does not mean the file is approved as far as compliance for Warnings, Dimensions, Ingredients, or any other legal requirement. Our approval only means it meets the graphic requirements provided by Walmart.</p>

Thanks & Best Regards  <br>
